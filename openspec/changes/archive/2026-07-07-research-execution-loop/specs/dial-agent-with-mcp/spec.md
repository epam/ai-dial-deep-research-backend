## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tool-calling agent over MCP-loaded tools

Each chat completion request SHALL first be handled by the preparation agent (see
the **clarification-and-plan-alignment** capability). When the preparation agent
approves a plan and calls `start_research`, the app SHALL run the **research
execution graph** (see the **research-execution** capability) in the same turn; the
research agent is the graph's **researcher node**, not a directly-invoked
first-message agent.

The researcher node SHALL be a fresh per-request LangChain `create_agent` over the
tools fetched from a freshly-constructed MCP client, plus one sentinel tool
(`finish_iteration`). It SHALL have access only to MCP-loaded tools and that
sentinel — no other built-in tools, subagents, skills, or persistent memory beyond
the graph state. The researcher SHALL be run with **forced tool choice** (every
model step emits a tool call) via an in-process `AgentMiddleware`, so the model
cannot emit a free-form assistant message; it ends an iteration by calling
`finish_iteration` (a `return_direct` sentinel). The previously-permitted reflection
middleware is removed; phase control now lives in the research graph's edges, not in
middleware that redirects a single agent's control flow.

The MCP client SHALL NOT be cached across requests, the app SHALL NOT open a
long-lived SSE listening stream on the MCP endpoint, and the app SHALL NOT issue or
retain an `Mcp-Session-Id`. Tool-list freshness across requests is achieved by
re-polling `tools/list` at the start of every turn that constructs a client,
matching the generic-RAG server's `stateless_http=True` deployment; persistent-session
features (long-lived sessions, `Mcp-Session-Id`, `Last-Event-ID` resumability,
`notifications/tools/list_changed`, `notifications/resources/*`,
`notifications/prompts/list_changed`) are out of scope for this capability.

#### Scenario: Researcher invokes an MCP tool

- **WHEN** the researcher needs information from the knowledge base during an iteration
- **THEN** it SHALL emit a tool call, the MCP server SHALL execute the tool, and the result SHALL be incorporated into the accumulated research context

#### Scenario: Researcher is run only after plan approval

- **WHEN** a chat completion request is processed and no plan has been approved yet
- **THEN** the researcher node SHALL NOT run and no MCP client SHALL be constructed for research; the turn SHALL produce only preparation output

#### Scenario: Per-request agent and MCP scoping

- **WHEN** the MCP server's tool list changes between two requests that reach research (e.g. the generic-RAG MCP server is redeployed)
- **THEN** the later research run SHALL discover and use the new tool list without restarting the dial-deep-research process

#### Scenario: No session reuse across requests

- **WHEN** the app processes two requests that each construct an MCP client
- **THEN** the app SHALL construct a new MCP client for the second rather than reusing the first's, the second's MCP traffic SHALL NOT carry an `Mcp-Session-Id` derived from the first, and any in-flight notifications received during the first request's POST SSE response SHALL have terminated with that request

### Requirement: Tool messages persisted via DIAL custom_content state

For every chat completion request, the app SHALL accumulate the ordered sequence of
`AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`, and injected `HumanMessage` instances observed during
the turn — for a research turn this is the research graph's slice: every researcher
`AIMessage` carrying `tool_calls`, every `ToolMessage` returned by a tool, every
next-iteration plan `HumanMessage` injected by the reviewer node, and the final
report `AIMessage` — and SHALL persist that sequence by serializing it via
`langchain_core.messages.messages_to_dict` and writing it under
`assistant.custom_content.state` (the `messages` field of the unified `DialState`).
The injected next-iteration plan `HumanMessage`s SHALL be captured in run order so
the persisted slice interleaves them at the positions the researcher saw them; they
SHALL NOT be appended to the user-visible assistant `content`. Before serialization,
the app SHALL traverse every message's `content` and, for every LangChain v1
`ImageContentBlock` carrying a `base64` field, replace the inline data with a `url`
reference per the **Tool-message image content uploaded to DIAL files before
persistence** requirement, so the persisted state SHALL NOT contain image byte
payloads. The DIAL `assistant.tool_calls` / `assistant.tool_call_id` native fields
SHALL NOT be populated by the app; the `custom_content.state["messages"]` blob is the
sole authoritative carrier of tool-call structure across turns.

The **final report** `AIMessage` SHALL be persisted into this slice too — not just
the intermediate tool-call messages — because the native `assistant.content` field
is a display-only concatenation of streamed text and carries no boundaries from
which the original message structure could be recovered.

#### Scenario: Research turn slice is fully persisted

- **WHEN** a research turn produces `AIMessage(tool_calls=[X]) → ToolMessage(X_result) → AIMessage(tool_calls=[finish_iteration]) → ToolMessage(finish_iteration) → [injected next-plan HumanMessage] → … → AIMessage(report)`
- **THEN** `custom_content.state["messages"]` SHALL carry those entries in run order, each encoded with its matching `messages_to_dict` `type` discriminator, the injected next-plan `HumanMessage` appearing at the position the researcher saw it, and the report `AIMessage` last

#### Scenario: Multimodal tool loop persists with image URLs, not image bytes

- **WHEN** a research turn produces a `ToolMessage` whose `content` includes one or more `{type: "image", base64, mime_type}` blocks
- **THEN** the persisted entry for that `ToolMessage` SHALL contain the same blocks rewritten to `{type: "image", url, mime_type}` (with `base64` absent), and the serialized state blob SHALL NOT include the original image byte payload

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Reflection-driven research/report loop

**Reason:** Replaced by the **research-execution** capability — a deterministic
research graph (researcher / reviewer / report nodes) whose control flow lives in
graph edges. The two prompt-defined phases, the research-complete signal, the
`gap_check` / `report_request` nudges, and the `ReflectionMiddleware` are removed:
the researcher is forced to call tools (so it cannot emit a premature report), and
an independent reviewer node — not a same-context gap-check — decides whether to
continue. The `MAX_REFLECTIONS` setting is superseded by `MAX_RESEARCH_ITERATIONS`
(the research-iteration cap).

**Migration:** None required (pre-production). Conversations are single-turn for
research; no persisted reflection-nudge state needs migrating.
